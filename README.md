# Enumerable Methods

> Ruby enumerables provide you with lots of handy iterator methods. In this project, I will rebuild those methods.

- The code needs to have `my_each`, `my_each_with_index`, `my_select`, `my_all?`, `my_any?`, `my_none?`, `my_count`, `my_map`, `my_inject`
- The code needs to have `multiply_els` method which multiplies all the elements of the array together by using `my_inject`
- The code needs to modify `my_map` method to take a proc
- The code needs to modify `my_map` method to take either a proc or a block
